# Selenium_Balance_Checker-Python_Selenium
🧰 Required Python Libraries
The following Python packages are required for this project:


Library	Install with	Purpose
selenium	pip install selenium	Automates browser interactions, page navigation, and element detection
pygame	pip install pygame	Used here for simple sound alerts when a monitored value changes
You must also install a browser driver (e.g., geckodriver for Firefox) and ensure it's added to your system PATH.

📌 General Use Case
Although this script is configured to monitor a value such as a balance on a website, its design allows for any kind of real-time content monitoring via a web interface.

💡 Example Use Cases
You can easily adapt this script to:

Detect and alert on new notifications or messages appearing in web dashboards

Monitor status changes (e.g., online/offline indicators, stock prices, ticket availability)

Watch for page content updates, such as live scores, comments, or order updates

Track the appearance or disappearance of elements (e.g., “Sold Out”, “Available”, “New Round”, etc.)

⚙️ How to Adapt the Script
To repurpose this script for another use case:

Change the selector of the element you want to monitor:

target_element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, 'your-target-class')

Replace the logic that compares the previous and current value.

Optionally, change the sound alert file (example.mp3) with your own notification tone.

This makes the script a powerful and flexible monitoring tool for non-intrusive automation and alerts on any modern website.
